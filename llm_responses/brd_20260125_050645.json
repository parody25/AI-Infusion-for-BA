    "overview": "This Business Requirements Specification defines the business, functional and high-level non-functional requirements for complying with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) mandate for adoption of the Jaywan domestic card scheme by Licensed Financial Institutions (LFIs). The document covers issuance and processing of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage and Jaywan co-badged cards in partnership with international payment schemes (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) for both domestic and international usage. The requirements address enablement of domestic routing through Jaywan for UAE domestic transactions, support for GCC usage where applicable, and interoperability with international schemes for cross-border transactions. The document also addresses high-level requirements for support of tokenised transactions (e.g. Samsung Wallet, Google Pay, Apple Pay), dual messaging models (existing Visa DMS and CBUAE DMS to-be), and alignment with Al Etihad Payments (AEP) guidelines and CBUAE circulars classified as Public.",
    "current_constraint": "The current environment processes card transactions predominantly through international schemes such as Visa and Mastercard, using existing dual messaging models for e-commerce and tokenisation transactions. Jaywan scheme rules, domestic routing preferences, and CBUAE DMS processes for e-commerce and tokenised transactions are not yet fully implemented. The financial institution is constrained by partial clarity on detailed AEP operating rules, reconciliation specifications, and final bilateral arrangements with external jurisdictions (e.g. India and other countries) which are targeted for mid-2025. Existing POS tokenised transaction flows may not yet be aligned with CBUAE DMS and Jaywan routing requirements. Current reporting and reconciliation processes are based on international schemes and may require adaptation once complete Jaywan documentation, including original reports and reconciliation specifications, is received from CBUAE/AEP.",
    "objective": "The primary objective is to ensure full and timely compliance with the CBUAE circular and related mandates (including the central bank mandate reference number 5480-2024, as referenced) that require all Licensed Financial Institutions to: (1) issue Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage as per AEP and CBUAE guidelines; (2) issue Jaywan co-badged cards with Visa or Mastercard that support both domestic (Jaywan) and international (Visa/Mastercard) transactions; (3) configure card routing rules so that domestic transactions are processed via the Jaywan domestic scheme in alignment with regulatory expectations on cost efficiency, financial sovereignty and digital payments strategy; and (4) progressively support tokenised usage of Jaywan on Samsung Wallet, and subsequently on Google Pay and Apple Pay, in accordance with AEP readiness and bilateral agreements. The objective includes ensuring that business processes, system changes, and operational controls are suitably defined to enable a secure, seamless, and cost-efficient payment experience that meets CBUAE and AEP requirements.",
    "in_scope": "Design and definition of business requirements necessary for: (1) issuance and lifecycle management of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage; (2) issuance and lifecycle management of Jaywan co-badged cards in partnership with Visa or Mastercard for domestic and international usage; (3) configuration of routing logic to ensure that eligible domestic UAE transactions shall be processed through Jaywan; (4) alignment of existing dual messaging processes with CBUAE DMS for e-commerce and tokenised transactions; (5) inclusion of POS tokenised transactions within the Jaywan and CBUAE DMS scope, subject to confirmation; (6) high-level reporting and reconciliation requirements aligned to CBUAE/AEP original reports; (7) capturing questions and clarifications to be raised with AEP; (8) definition of operational impacts on Card Operations, GBO-ATM/CDM and other relevant units as discussed in discovery and clarification sessions.",
    "out_of_scope": "Detailed technical solution design, application architecture and low-level interface specifications with AEP and international schemes are out of scope. Scheme rule drafting for AEP or CBUAE is out of scope. Pricing, interchange, and commercial negotiations with schemes or partners are out of scope. Detailed configuration of Samsung Wallet, Google Pay and Apple Pay by wallet providers is out of scope beyond business requirements for enablement. Detailed bilateral agreement content with India or other countries is out of scope; only business readiness requirements for supporting such agreements are in scope. Any non-card payment products and non-Jaywan related enhancements are out of scope.",
    "reference_documents": "CBUAE Circular on Jaywan Domestic Card Scheme (Public Classification) including mandate for Jaywan co-badged card issuance; CBUAE mandate reference number 5480-2024 regarding support for domestic and international transactions; AEP communication on Jaywan launch readiness (27 February 2025); AEP public material titled “Jaywan: UAE's First Domestic Card Scheme Introduced to Strengthen the UAE's Position as a Global Hub for Digital Payments”; internal process documentation for current SMS (ATM, POS), current Visa DMS (Visa e-commerce and tokenisation transactions), and to-be CBUAE DMS (for e-commerce and tokenisation transactions); meeting minutes and discovery session documentation involving Business, IT, Card Operations, GBO-ATM/CDM, Finance and other stakeholders; original report shared by CBUAE for reporting and reconciliation."

      "to_be_behaviour": "Routing rules shall be updated so that, for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, transactions originating from UAE merchants and ATMs classified as domestic shall be routed via Jaywan. The card management and switch systems shall recognise Jaywan BINs and routing indicators and shall enforce routing preferences in line with CBUAE and AEP expectations to reduce domestic payment costs.",
