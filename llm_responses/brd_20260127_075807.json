    "id": "BRS-JAYWAN-COBADGE-001",
    "program": "Jaywan Domestic Card Scheme Enablement for Licensed Financial Institutions in the UAE",
    "type": "Business Requirement Specification",
    "overview": "This document specifies the business requirements for enabling the UAE domestic card scheme \"Jaywan\" for mono-badged and co-badged cards in compliance with Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) and Al Etihad Payments (AEP) directives. The requirements cover issuance, usage, routing, dual messaging, reversals, refunds, chargebacks, tokenisation, wallet enablement and reporting for domestic and international card transactions processed under the Jaywan scheme and its co-badged constructs with international payment networks.",
    "current_constraint": "Current card issuing and acquiring infrastructure at licensed financial institutions primarily supports international schemes (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) and existing CBUAE/Visa dual messaging services. Domestic routing for a national scheme such as Jaywan is not fully enabled. Card products are largely non-co-badged and may not comply with CBUAE mandate reference 5480/2024 requiring support for both domestic and international transactions. POS tokenised transaction handling, Jaywan-specific GL mapping, reconciliation processes, and reporting formats as required by AEP/CBUAE are not fully defined or implemented. Existing mobile wallet integrations (Samsung Wallet, Google Pay, Apple Pay) are not yet configured for Jaywan card provisioning and usage across mono-badge and co-badge products.",
    "objective": "The objective is to define and implement business and system changes necessary for the bank, as a licensed financial institution, to comply with the CBUAE mandate to launch Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, ensure correct domestic and international transaction routing, and support secure, cost-effective, and seamless payments in line with CBUAE and AEP requirements. The solution shall enable issuance, acceptance, processing, and settlement of Jaywan transactions locally and, where applicable, in GCC and other approved markets, while maintaining interoperability with international schemes and supporting digital wallet and tokenisation use cases.",
    "in_scope": "1. Enablement of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic usage within the UAE and GCC as per AEP guidance.\n2. Enablement of Jaywan co-badged cards in partnership with international schemes (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) for domestic and international transactions.\n3. Configuration of domestic and international routing rules for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards in accordance with CBUAE mandate reference 5480/2024 and AEP specifications.\n4. Support for card-present and card-not-present (e-commerce and tokenised) transactions for Jaywan in dual messaging environments including CBUAE DMS and existing Visa DMS where applicable.\n5. Support for POS tokenised transactions for Jaywan cards, including digital wallet usage (Samsung Wallet readiness and subsequent enablement for Google Pay and Apple Pay as per AEP roadmap).\n6. Updates to business processes and system interfaces for authorisations, clearings, reversals, refunds, and chargebacks relating to Jaywan transactions.\n7. Definition and mapping of General Ledger (GL) accounts and reconciliation processes for Jaywan domestic and international legs for both issuing and acquiring.\n8. Regulatory and scheme reporting to AEP/CBUAE and internal stakeholders covering Jaywan transaction volumes, fees, service levels, and exception handling.\n9. Business and IT collaboration with AEP, including formal query management to clarify scheme rules, dual messaging processes, and adoption of relevant processes used today for Visa for Jaywan.\n10. Training and communication to impacted business units (Card Operations, Finance, Reconciliation, IT, Contact Centre, Branches) on Jaywan products, processes, and responsibilities.",
    "out_of_scope": "1. Detailed technical design documents, interface control documents (ICDs), and code-level specifications.\n2. Changes to non-card payment rails (e.g. RTGS, ACH, instant payments) not related to Jaywan card processing.\n3. Pricing strategy and commercial fee negotiations with AEP or international schemes, beyond high-level requirements to support fee capture and reporting.\n4. Marketing campaign content and creative design, except for basic functional readiness to support CBUAE/AEP awareness initiatives.\n5. Non-UAE regulatory requirements not explicitly referenced by CBUAE or AEP for Jaywan.\n6. Core banking product changes unrelated to card accounts or card-linked current/savings accounts.\n7. Detailed implementation of bilateral agreements with foreign jurisdictions beyond supporting the scheme-level requirements (e.g. the India bilateral agreement) once provided by AEP."
