    "overview": "This Business Requirement Specification defines the high-level and detailed business requirements for implementing the UAE domestic card payment scheme “Jaywan” in alignment with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) mandate and Al Etihad Payments (AEP) circulars. The document covers enablement of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage, Jaywan co‑badged cards in conjunction with international schemes, domestic routing of transactions, readiness of supporting payment infrastructure, and alignment with existing dual message systems (DMS) and settlement processes. The specification is intended for use by Business, Operations, Payments, Cards, IT, and Compliance functions to ensure a consistent, regulatory-compliant implementation across all impacted channels and systems.",
    "current_constraint": "The bank currently issues international scheme cards (e.g. Visa and MasterCard) and supports existing dual message systems for e-commerce, tokenisation, and SMS-based ATM/POS transactions. A domestic card scheme (Jaywan) is not yet fully enabled across issuing and acquiring channels. Routing is primarily configured for international card schemes, and domestic transaction cost optimisation via a local scheme is not fully realised. Requirements and rules from AEP for Jaywan, including detailed technical and operational specifications, are partially available and further clarifications are required via discovery sessions and queries to AEP. Integration with mobile wallets (Samsung Wallet currently, Google Pay and Apple Pay planned) and bilateral cross-border arrangements (e.g. India) for Jaywan are not fully defined in the bank’s internal processes. Reconciliation and GL mapping specific to Jaywan are in progress and dependent on final confirmation from Finance and AEP.",
    "objective": "The bank shall implement Jaywan as a domestic card payment scheme in compliance with CBUAE circulars and AEP guidance, ensuring that all licensed financial institution obligations are met. The bank shall issue Jaywan co‑badged cards in conjunction with Visa or MasterCard for cards supporting both domestic and international transactions, in line with the central bank mandate reference 5480-2024. The bank shall configure card routing so that domestic and GCC transactions are processed via the Jaywan scheme where applicable, while international transactions are processed via the relevant international scheme. The bank shall enable mono-badged Jaywan cards for domestic and GCC usage as per AEP guidelines. The implementation shall reduce payment transaction costs, support financial sovereignty, and provide a secure, seamless payment experience across physical and digital channels, including POS, ATM, e-commerce, tokenised transactions, and supported mobile wallets.",
    "in_scope": "Implementation of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage in accordance with AEP and CBUAE requirements. Implementation of Jaywan co‑badged cards with Visa or MasterCard for domestic and international usage in line with CBUAE mandate 5480-2024. Configuration of card and transaction routing rules so that domestic transactions are processed via Jaywan and international transactions via the appropriate international scheme. Alignment of issuing and acquiring processes, including dual messaging system (DMS) flows for Jaywan e-commerce and tokenised transactions, with existing VISA DMS and SMS flows. Inclusion of POS tokenised transactions for Jaywan where confirmed as in scope by Business and AEP. Definition and documentation of end-to-end process flows for Jaywan-related ATM, POS, e-commerce, reversals, refunds, chargebacks, reconciliation, and GL postings. Setup of operational and regulatory reporting to CBUAE/AEP related to Jaywan transaction volumes, performance, and compliance. Participation in discovery sessions for additional requirements for Jaywan mono-badged and co‑badged cards with Business and IT stakeholders. Enablement of Jaywan cards for supported digital wallets (starting with Samsung Wallet and later Google Pay and Apple Pay when mandated) and alignment with AEP timelines where applicable.",
    "out_of_scope": "Definition of detailed AEP or CBUAE scheme rules beyond what is provided in official circulars and scheme documentation. Technical low-level design (LLD) and solution design for host systems, switches, and external interfaces. Commercial pricing strategy and interchange fee negotiation with AEP and international schemes. Marketing content creation for Jaywan awareness campaigns beyond high-level requirements for customer communication. Definition of bilateral agreement details with foreign jurisdictions (e.g. India) beyond bank-side readiness requirements. Non-card payment channels that are not impacted by Jaywan (e.g. non-card-based instant payments) unless explicitly stated by CBUAE or AEP. Changes to non-UAE regulatory frameworks or requirements not directly linked to CBUAE or AEP guidance.",
    "reference_documents": "CBUAE Mandate Reference Number 5480-2024 regarding mandatory issuance of Jaywan co‑badged cards by licensed financial institutions.

The bank shall ensure that co‑badged cards comply with AEP and CBUAE scheme rules and that cardholders can transact domestically via Jaywan and internationally via the corresponding international scheme.",
      "as_is_behaviour": "Currently, the bank issues cards that are primarily mono-badged with international schemes (e.g. Visa or MasterCard) and routes all transactions through those schemes. Domestic transactions are not routed through a UAE domestic card scheme, and co‑badging with Jaywan is not yet implemented.",
      "to_be_behaviour": "The bank shall configure card issuance processes so that new and replacement cards intended for domestic and international usage are issued as Jaywan co‑badged cards with either Visa or MasterCard. The card plastic and personalisation data shall include both Jaywan and the selected international scheme identifiers as per AEP and scheme specifications. Domestic transactions shall be routed through Jaywan, while international transactions shall be routed through the respective international scheme.

The system shall ensure that all new cards created under the defined product codes carry Jaywan and the respective international scheme identifiers as per scheme rules. The solution shall ensure that a domestic test transaction on a co‑badged card is routed via Jaywan, and an international test transaction is routed via the relevant international scheme. Compliance shall confirm that issuance of co‑badged cards is aligned to CBUAE mandate 5480-2024. A sample of production co‑badged cards shall be validated by Cards Operations and AEP where required prior to full rollout.",
      "alternate_flows": "If a legacy mono-badged product cannot be immediately converted to a Jaywan co‑badged product, the bank shall define a phased migration plan where existing mono-badged cardholders are migrated to co‑badged cards at renewal or targeted reissuance. If an international scheme is temporarily unavailable, the system shall continue to support domestic transactions via Jaywan where permitted by scheme rules, and appropriate customer communication shall be triggered."
