    "overview": "This Business Requirements Document (BRD) specifies the business, regulatory and operational requirements for implementing the CBUAE-mandated Jaywan domestic payment card scheme, including mono-badge Jaywan cards and Jaywan co-badged cards, within a licensed financial institution in the UAE. The BRD covers the enablement of Jaywan as a domestic scheme for ATM, POS, e-commerce and tokenized transactions, the issuance of Jaywan mono-badge and Jaywan co-badged cards (with Visa or Mastercard), and the necessary changes to routing, clearing, reconciliation and reporting to comply with CBUAE and Al Etihad Payments (AEP) mandates. The BRD also considers readiness for enablement with major digital wallets and alignment with bilateral expansion plans, while ensuring reduced payment costs, financial sovereignty, and a secure and seamless payment experience for customers and merchants in line with the UAE’s position as a global digital payments hub.",
    "current_constraint": "Currently, the bank issues international scheme cards (e.g. Visa and Mastercard) for domestic and international transactions without a domestic card scheme routing option. Domestic UAE transactions are predominantly routed via international schemes, resulting in higher scheme fees and limited control over domestic payment infrastructure. Existing processes, system configurations and GL structures are aligned to the current SMS (ATM, POS) and Visa Dual Message System (DMS) for e-commerce and tokenization transactions. There is no production-ready enablement of the Jaywan domestic scheme, no mono-badge Jaywan cards in circulation, and no co-badged Jaywan cards configured for dual domestic and international routing. Current card tokenization, digital wallet integration and chargeback, refund and reversal processes are defined for international schemes only. Existing reconciliation processes and reports are aligned to current schemes and may not yet be adapted to CBUAE / AEP requirements for Jaywan. There are open clarifications with AEP regarding detailed process flows, message formats, reporting and reconciliation for Jaywan dual messaging and tokenized POS transactions.",
    "objective": "The objective is to implement Jaywan as the national domestic card payment scheme in compliance with CBUAE and Al Etihad Payments mandates, including Central Bank mandate reference number 5480-2024, by enabling issuance and processing of Jaywan mono-badge and Jaywan co-badged cards. The solution shall ensure that domestic transactions in the UAE are routed via the Jaywan domestic scheme, while international transactions continue to be routed via the co-badged international scheme where applicable. The implementation shall reduce domestic payment transaction costs, enhance financial sovereignty, and provide a secure, seamless and inclusive payment experience for both individuals and corporates. The bank shall achieve readiness of financial infrastructure to activate Jaywan locally and support its expansion to GCC and selected international corridors, while maintaining full compliance with CBUAE regulatory, reporting, security and customer protection requirements.",
    "in_scope": "Implementation of Jaywan mono-badge card issuance for domestic and GCC usage as per AEP and CBUAE guidance. Implementation of Jaywan co-badged card issuance in combination with Visa or Mastercard to support both domestic and international transactions. Configuration of card routing rules to ensure that domestic UAE transactions shall be processed via Jaywan and that international transactions shall be routed via the relevant international scheme for co-badged cards. Enablement of Jaywan for ATM, POS, e-commerce and tokenized transactions, including dual messaging as required by AEP. Assessment and potential inclusion of POS tokenized transactions within Jaywan scope. Alignment of GL account structures and posting rules for Jaywan-related transaction flows as confirmed by the Finance team. Design and documentation of to-be process flows for CBUAE DMS for e-commerce and tokenized transactions. Changes to chargeback, reversal and refund processes to incorporate Jaywan-specific rules, SLAs and workflows, aligned to AEP documentation. Setup of reconciliation processes and reports for Jaywan scheme transactions based on original reports received from CBUAE / AEP. Discovery sessions and requirement elaboration for additional needs related to Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, as per the meeting schedule. Integration planning for Jaywan card usage in digital wallets (e.g. Samsung Wallet in initial phase and subsequent enablement on Google Pay and Apple Pay, subject to AEP timelines). Internal and external stakeholder engagement, including clarification of queries with AEP and alignment with CBUAE circulars and guidance notes.",
    "out_of_scope": "Detailed technical design, low-level system architecture and code-level implementation for host systems, switch, CMS, and channel applications. Commercial pricing models, interchange fee negotiations, and revenue-sharing arrangements with AEP or international schemes. Detailed definition of marketing campaign content beyond high-level alignment with AEP awareness initiatives. Implementation of bilateral agreements between AEP and foreign jurisdictions (e.g. India and other countries) beyond ensuring bank readiness to support such corridors when activated. Replacement or decommissioning strategy of existing non-Jaywan cards outside of the minimum changes required to comply with the co-badging mandate. Non-card payment instruments and schemes (e.g. account-to-account, instant payments) except where they intersect with card settlement and GL postings. Development of detailed SOC, infrastructure sizing and capacity planning documents beyond the high-level non-functional requirements specified herein.",
    "reference_documents": "CBUAE Circular on Jaywan Domestic Card Scheme and Co-badging Mandate, including Central Bank mandate reference number 5480-2024. Al Etihad Payments (AEP) official communication on Jaywan launch readiness dated 27 February 2025. AEP scheme rulebooks and implementation guides for Jaywan mono-badge and co-badged cards. Current process documentation for SMS (ATM, POS) and Visa DMS (e-commerce and tokenization). CBUAE DMS to-be process documentation for e-commerce and tokenized transactions as provided by AEP / CBUAE. Original CBUAE / AEP reconciliation and reporting specifications shared with the bank.
