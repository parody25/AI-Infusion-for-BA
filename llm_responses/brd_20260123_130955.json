    "overview": "This Business Requirements Specification defines the business, regulatory and operational requirements for the implementation of the UAE domestic card scheme “Jaywan”, covering both mono-badged Jaywan cards for domestic and GCC usage and co-badged Jaywan cards with international schemes (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) for domestic and international usage. The requirements are based on the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) mandate and circulars, and on the readiness of the Al Etihad Payments (AEP) infrastructure to support domestic card issuing and acquiring, including enablement for e‑commerce, tokenisation, mobile wallets and cross-border usage as communicated for the 2025 launch.",
    "current_constraint": "CBUAE has mandated that all licensed financial institutions issuing international scheme cards (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) shall in future issue Jaywan co-badged cards in accordance with CBUAE circular and mandate reference number 5480/2024. Existing card portfolios are predominantly single-badged international scheme cards with routing primarily via international networks for both domestic and international transactions, resulting in higher transaction costs and limited utilisation of domestic payment infrastructure. Detailed technical specifications, finalised routing rules, full reconciliation models and certain bilateral cross-border Jaywan arrangements are governed by AEP documentation and are not fully covered in the provided context.",
    "objective": "The licensed financial institution shall comply with the CBUAE mandate to enable Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, leveraging the AEP domestic card infrastructure to reduce domestic payment costs, enhance financial sovereignty, and provide secure, seamless payment experiences that meet UAE market requirements. The bank shall ensure that card issuing, acquiring, authorisation, clearing, settlement, GL accounting, dispute handling and reporting processes are updated to support Jaywan domestic routing for eligible transactions while maintaining international routing for cross-border usage via the co-badge schemes.",
    "in_scope": "1. Implementation of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage, as per AEP and CBUAE guidance.\n2. Implementation of Jaywan co-badged cards with international schemes (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) for domestic and international usage, aligned with CBUAE circular reference 5480/2024.\n3. Configuration of card routing rules to process eligible domestic transactions through the Jaywan domestic scheme and eligible international transactions through the relevant international scheme.\n4. Integration with AEP domestic switching, authorisation and settlement infrastructure, including dual messaging where applicable.\n5. Support for ATM, POS, e‑commerce and tokenised transactions (including mobile wallets) under the Jaywan scheme, subject to AEP specifications.\n6. Updates to operational processes for reversals, refunds, chargebacks, reconciliation and GL postings for Jaywan transactions.\n7. Reporting to internal stakeholders and to CBUAE/AEP as required by applicable circulars and reporting formats, where made available to the bank.\n8. Discovery and documentation of additional business requirements arising from planned discovery sessions for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, as per the provided meeting schedule.",
    "out_of_scope": "1. Detailed technical design, network certification and scheme certification activities, which shall be covered under separate technical design and implementation documents.\n2. Definition or modification of AEP or CBUAE scheme rules, interchange structures, fee models and bilateral agreements with foreign jurisdictions (e.g. India), which are owned by AEP/CBUAE.\n3. Non-card payment channels and instruments (e.g. account‑to‑account instant payments, cheques, wire transfers) unless explicitly linked to Jaywan card usage.\n4. Detailed infrastructure sizing, hardware procurement, and low-level performance tuning activities.\n5. Marketing, brand design and external campaign content for Jaywan awareness, which shall be handled by the bank’s Marketing / Communications functions in alignment with AEP campaigns.\n6. Development of specifications for Samsung Wallet, Google Pay and Apple Pay beyond the business requirement to support tokenised and wallet transactions under Jaywan, which will be addressed in separate channel-specific initiatives based on AEP enablement plans.",
    "reference_documents": "1. CBUAE circular and mandate reference number 5480/2024 relating to mandatory issuance of Jaywan co-badged cards by licensed financial institutions issuing Visa or Mastercard cards (exact circular text to be referenced from official CBUAE communication).\n2. CBUAE and Al Etihad Payments communication: \"Jaywan – the UAE's First Domestic Card Scheme Introduced to Strengthen the UAE's Position as a Global Hub for Digital Payments\" (CBUAE Classification: Public).\n3. Al Etihad Payments announcement of Jaywan domestic card scheme readiness dated 27 February 2025.\n4. AEP scheme documentation on Jaywan mono-badge and co-badge operating rules, including routing, authorisation, clearing, settlement, and dispute management (to be obtained from AEP).\n5. Internal bank process documentation for current SMS (ATM, POS), Visa Dual Messaging System (e‑commerce and tokenisation), and CBUAE DMS to‑be process flows, as shared between Business, IT, Card Operations and GBO-ATM/CDM teams.\n6. Meeting minutes and discovery session artefacts referencing queries to AEP, report samples, GL details, and reconciliation documentation shared by Finance and other stakeholders."

  },
  "impact_on_operational_process": "Operational processes across Card Operations, GBO-ATM/CDM, Reconciliation, Finance, Customer Service and Dispute Management shall be updated to incorporate Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged flows. This includes new SOPs for card issuance and maintenance, routing and network monitoring, transaction investigations, reconciliation and GL postings, reversals, refunds, chargebacks and regulatory reporting. Existing process documentation for SMS (ATM, POS), Visa DMS (e‑commerce and tokenisation) and CBUAE DMS to‑be flows shall be extended to cover Jaywan-specific paths. Additional workload is expected during migration and early adoption phases, requiring resourcing and workload planning.",

The bank shall ensure full compliance with CBUAE and AEP scheme rules on routing, consumer protection, dispute handling, reporting, AML/CFT, data retention and operational resilience. Regulatory reporting obligations for Jaywan transaction data and performance metrics shall be met as per prescribed formats and timelines. Any deviations or phased approaches shall be documented and, where required, agreed with CBUAE.",

Report formats and data definitions shall be aligned with original reports received from CBUAE and AEP and internal data governance standards.",

Card Operations, Finance, Reconciliation, Risk, Compliance, IT Support and Business teams shall be granted access strictly on a need-to-know basis, segregating duties between transaction processing, approval and reconciliation. Access to regulatory reporting and sensitive scheme data shall be restricted to authorised personnel and subject to periodic review. External access to AEP and CBUAE interfaces shall be controlled through secure channels and governed by appropriate authentication and authorisation mechanisms.",
  "security_requirement": "Jaywan implementation shall adhere to the bank’s information security policies, CBUAE regulations and applicable scheme-level security standards. Cardholder data and transaction data shall be protected in transit and at rest using industry-accepted encryption and key management practices. Tokenised and wallet-based Jaywan transactions shall use secure tokenisation and device binding as per AEP and wallet provider specifications. Access to production systems shall be controlled, logged and monitored. Security incident management procedures shall be updated to include Jaywan-specific threat scenarios.

Data models in transaction processing systems, data warehouse and reporting layers shall be extended to distinguish Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged transactions from other schemes.

Reference materials such as FAQs, process maps and quick reference guides shall be developed and maintained. Participation in AEP or CBUAE-led awareness programmes shall be encouraged to ensure consistent understanding across the ecosystem."
