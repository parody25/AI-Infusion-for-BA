    "program": "Jaywan Domestic Card Scheme Enablement for Licensed Financial Institutions",
    "type": "Business Requirement Specification",
    "overview": "This document captures the business requirements for implementing the UAE domestic card scheme \"Jaywan\" across licensed financial institutions in alignment with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) mandate and Al Etihad Payments (AEP) directives. The requirements cover issuance and processing of Jaywan mono‑badge cards for domestic and GCC usage, Jaywan co‑badged cards in partnership with international schemes (e.g. Visa, MasterCard) for both domestic and international usage, configuration of routing for domestic vs international transactions, readiness of financial infrastructure, and support for digital wallets and tokenisation channels. The document also reflects discovery discussions between Business and IT teams related to dual messaging, reversals, refunds, chargebacks, reconciliation and reporting for Jaywan.",
    "current_constraint": "The institution currently issues and processes only international scheme cards (e.g. Visa, MasterCard) and does not support Jaywan mono‑badge or Jaywan co‑badged cards. Existing card management, authorisation, clearing, GL and reconciliation processes are aligned to international scheme rules and messaging standards. Domestic e‑commerce and tokenised transactions are currently processed via international schemes only. Detailed CBUAE / AEP technical specifications, final interchange and fee structures, and some aspects of chargeback and dispute flows for Jaywan are not fully available in the provided context and shall be obtained directly from AEP and CBUAE circulars.",
    "objective": "The institution shall comply with the CBUAE circular and central government mandate requiring licensed financial institutions to launch Jaywan mono‑badge and Jaywan co‑badged cards in accordance with mandate reference number 5480-2024. The institution shall enable a secure, cost‑efficient domestic card payment ecosystem supporting domestic and GCC transactions via Jaywan, and international transactions via the co‑badged international scheme. The card routing shall be configured so that eligible domestic transactions are processed via Jaywan to reduce payment costs and enhance financial sovereignty, while ensuring seamless payment experiences for cardholders across POS, ATM, e‑commerce, tokenised and wallet transactions.",
    "in_scope": "Implementation of Jaywan mono‑badge debit and/or prepaid cards for domestic UAE and GCC usage as per AEP and CBUAE rules; implementation of Jaywan co‑badged cards with international schemes (Visa, MasterCard) for dual domestic (Jaywan) and international (scheme) usability; configuration of routing logic to direct domestic eligible transactions to Jaywan and international transactions to the international scheme; enablement of Jaywan usage at POS, ATM/CDM, e‑commerce and tokenised channels; alignment of dual messaging processes for Jaywan similar to existing VISA DMS where applicable; updates to GL mapping, posting rules and reconciliation processes for Jaywan transactions; support for digital wallet provisioning and usage (e.g. Samsung Wallet in initial phase, with roadmap alignment for Google Pay and Apple Pay); definition of reporting and MI requirements related to Jaywan volumes, costs, revenue and compliance; incorporation of CBUAE / AEP requirements into internal operational procedures, customer communication and awareness activities at bank level.",
    "out_of_scope": "Design of AEP or CBUAE central infrastructure for Jaywan scheme; detailed technical network connectivity design between the bank and AEP switching systems; definition of Jaywan interchange, fee tariffs and chargeback rules at scheme level; bilateral cross‑border arrangements between AEP and other countries (e.g. India) beyond ensuring the bank’s systems can technically process such transactions when later activated; enterprise‑wide digital wallet strategy beyond requirements specific to Jaywan card enablement; non‑card payment instruments and non‑Jaywan related products."
