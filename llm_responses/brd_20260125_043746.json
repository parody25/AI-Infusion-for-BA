    "overview": "This Business Requirement Specification defines the business and regulatory requirements for implementing the CBUAE-mandated Jaywan domestic card scheme, including Jaywan mono-badged cards and Jaywan co-badged cards in conjunction with international schemes (e.g. Visa, Mastercard). The document addresses alignment with the CBUAE circular (including mandate reference 5480/2024), Al Etihad Payments (AEP) scheme rules, and the readiness of licensed financial institutions to support domestic and international card transactions, tokenised payments, and bilateral arrangements as communicated by CBUAE and AEP. The requirements cover customer-facing products, transaction routing, dual messaging processes, reconciliation, chargebacks, integration with digital wallets, and reporting obligations.",
    "current_constraint": "Licensed financial institutions currently issue international scheme cards (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) that do not fully comply with the CBUAE mandate for domestic card scheme enablement and co-badging. Existing card management and switching infrastructures are primarily configured for international scheme routing and do not natively support Jaywan domestic routing rules, mono-badge issuance or co-badged card routing logic. Current processes and documentation focus on existing VISA Dual Message System (DMS) for e-commerce and tokenisation transactions and do not fully reflect CBUAE Domestic Message System (DMS) requirements for Jaywan. POS tokenised transactions and Jaywan-specific reversal, refund, and chargeback flows are not fully defined. Reconciliation and GL configuration for Jaywan are partially documented and subject to confirmation from Finance and CBUAE/AEP. Existing reporting is aligned with current schemes and does not yet include Jaywan-specific regulatory and scheme reports.",
    "objective": "The objective is to define business requirements that shall enable the bank, as a CBUAE-licensed financial institution, to: (1) comply with the central government and CBUAE circular mandating the issuance and acceptance of Jaywan mono-badged and Jaywan co-badged cards (CBUAE mandate reference 5480/2024); (2) support domestic and international transactions in accordance with Jaywan and international scheme rules; (3) configure card routing so that domestic UAE and GCC transactions are processed via Jaywan where applicable while international transactions are routed via the relevant international scheme; (4) ensure readiness of financial and technology infrastructure for local and cross-border usage, including digital wallets and bilateral country agreements as enabled by AEP; and (5) provide customers with a secure, seamless, and cost-effective payment experience that strengthens the UAE’s financial sovereignty and supports CBUAE’s vision of the UAE as a global hub for digital payments.",
    "in_scope": "Design and implementation of Jaywan mono-badged debit and/or prepaid cards for domestic and GCC usage as per AEP and CBUAE scheme rules. Design and implementation of Jaywan co-badged cards in partnership with international schemes (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) for domestic and international usage in line with CBUAE circular 5480/2024. Configuration of domestic and international routing rules for ATM, POS, e-commerce, and tokenised transactions (including Samsung Wallet and future Google Pay and Apple Pay enablement) to ensure Jaywan is used for eligible domestic and GCC transactions. Update of card management system (CMS), switch, host, and settlement interfaces to support Jaywan scheme requirements and CBUAE Domestic Message System (DMS) for e-commerce and tokenised transactions. Definition and documentation of end-to-end process flows covering authorisation, clearing and settlement, reversals, refunds, chargebacks, reconciliation and GL postings for Jaywan transactions. Regulatory and scheme reporting requirements related to Jaywan transactions for CBUAE and AEP, including operational and financial reporting. Business participation in discovery sessions and clarification meetings regarding Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, including alignment with existing VISA processes where relevant. Internal training and awareness for business, operations, contact centre, and frontline staff on new Jaywan products, processes, and customer communication.",
    "out_of_scope": "Detailed low-level technical design and coding specifications for switch, CMS, and integration components. Pricing strategy and interchange fee negotiations with AEP or international schemes. Detailed marketing campaign content beyond high-level requirements to align with AEP awareness initiatives. Changes to non-card products and channels not impacted by Jaywan transactions (e.g. standalone loan products, non-card digital banking features not related to card payments). Definition of AEP or CBUAE external processes, scheme rules, or bilateral agreements outside the information formally communicated to the bank.",
    "reference_documents": "CBUAE circular mandating co-badged Jaywan cards (including mandate reference 5480/2024) as communicated to licensed financial institutions. Al Etihad Payments (AEP) communications and scheme documentation on Jaywan domestic card scheme readiness (including February 27, 2025 announcement). CBUAE and AEP documentation on Domestic Message System (DMS) for e-commerce and tokenisation transactions. Existing VISA Dual Message System (DMS) and related process documentation for ATM, POS, e-commerce and tokenised transactions used as reference for Jaywan alignment. Meeting minutes and discovery session records between Business, IT, Card Operations, GBO-ATM/CDM and other stakeholders regarding Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged implementation. Finance-confirmed GL structure and reconciliation documentation related to card schemes and Jaywan."

    "no_of_users": "The solution shall support all existing and new retail and corporate card customers of the bank who are eligible for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, with the ability to scale as CBUAE mandates expand adoption across the licensed financial institution’s customer base.",
    "peak_volume": "The solution shall support peak transaction volumes consistent with seasonal and event-driven spikes (e.g. public holidays and salary days), with capacity sizing aligned to projected Jaywan transaction growth and CBUAE expectations for national infrastructure resilience.",
    "monthly_volume": "The solution shall be designed to handle monthly Jaywan transaction volumes proportional to a growing share of domestic and GCC card usage, with ability to accommodate year-on-year growth as more cards are migrated or newly issued under the Jaywan scheme.",
    "availability": "Jaywan-related services shall target high availability consistent with CBUAE expectations for critical payment systems, ensuring that card authorisation and transaction processing are resilient and that planned downtime is minimised and communicated in advance."

Contact centre and branch teams shall adopt new scripts and procedures for handling Jaywan-related queries and disputes. Reconciliation teams shall include Jaywan scheme files and GL postings in daily, monthly, and regulatory reconciliations. Incident and service management processes shall incorporate Jaywan-specific incident categorisation and escalation paths, especially for network or scheme outages. Documentation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) shall be revised to distinguish between Jaywan, VISA, Mastercard, and other schemes where process differences exist.",
  "regulatory_impact": "The implementation of Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards is directly driven by CBUAE regulatory mandates, including the circular referencing mandate number 5480/2024, and related AEP scheme communications. The bank shall ensure full compliance with CBUAE requirements on domestic card schemes, transaction routing priorities, reporting obligations, customer protection, and operational resilience. Regulatory impact includes the need for ongoing reporting to CBUAE and AEP, adherence to domestic scheme rules for disputes and chargebacks, and alignment with any future CBUAE guidance on cross-border usage (e.g. GCC and bilateral agreements such as those with India). Non-compliance may result in supervisory findings, penalties, or mandated remediation, therefore regulatory tracking and governance for Jaywan shall be established as part of the bank’s compliance framework.",
  "reports_requirement": "The bank shall establish Jaywan-specific reporting capabilities, including but not limited to: (1) regulatory reports to CBUAE and AEP on transaction volumes, values, adoption rates, service levels, fraud incidents, and dispute statistics for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards; (2) internal management information reports and dashboards summarising Jaywan usage by segment, channel, geography, and card type; (3) operational reports supporting reconciliation and settlement, including scheme settlement summaries, break reports, and ageing of unreconciled items; and (4) exception and incident reports highlighting Jaywan network outages, declines, or unusual patterns requiring risk oversight. Reports shall be produced with agreed periodicity (e.g. daily, monthly, quarterly) as mandated or requested by regulators and internal stakeholders.",
  "access_requirement": "Access to Jaywan-related systems, data, and configuration (e.g. routing tables, BIN configurations, reconciliation tools, reporting platforms) shall be controlled on a need-to-know and least-privilege basis, in accordance with the bank’s information security and CBUAE guidelines. Role-based access control shall be defined for Operations, IT, Finance, Compliance, and other functions interacting with Jaywan data and processes. Any access to modify critical parameters such as routing rules, BINs, and GL mappings shall require appropriate approvals and be logged for audit purposes. Access to customer and transaction-level Jaywan data shall comply with data privacy and confidentiality obligations under UAE regulations and CBUAE standards.",
  "security_requirement": "The bank shall ensure that Jaywan implementation adheres to applicable CBUAE, AEP, and international security standards for card payments, including protection of Primary Account Numbers (PANs), CVV/CVC, PIN, and tokenised data. Encryption, tokenisation, and secure key management practices shall be applied consistently across issuing, acquiring, and wallet integration layers. Fraud monitoring rules shall be extended to cover Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged transactions across ATM, POS, e-commerce, and tokenised channels. Security controls shall address the full transaction life cycle, including authorisation, clearing, settlement, and disputes, and shall be integrated with the bank’s Security Operations Centre (SOC) and fraud management functions. Any security incidents affecting Jaywan shall be reported and managed in line with CBUAE cyber security and incident reporting requirements.",
  "data_requirement": "The bank shall capture and store Jaywan transaction and account data necessary to support operational processing, reconciliation, dispute handling, and regulatory reporting. Data elements shall include, at minimum, card scheme identifiers (Jaywan vs international scheme), channel indicators (ATM, POS, e-commerce, tokenised), geographic data, merchant category information, and dispute flags. Data retention and archival for Jaywan transactions shall comply with CBUAE data retention requirements and internal policies. Data quality controls shall ensure accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of Jaywan data across source systems and the data warehouse. Any data interfaces to CBUAE, AEP, or external partners shall be designed to ensure integrity and confidentiality of Jaywan-related data.",
  "training_requirement": "The bank shall deliver targeted training on Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged card products and processes to relevant staff, including Branch staff, Contact Centre agents, Card Operations, GBO-ATM/CDM, Reconciliation teams, IT support, Compliance, and Risk. Training shall cover regulatory context (including CBUAE circular and mandate 5480/2024), product features, transaction flows, routing logic, dispute handling, and security obligations. Training materials shall be documented and stored in the bank’s learning management repositories, and completion shall be tracked for key roles. Refresher training shall be scheduled when there are significant changes to Jaywan scheme rules, regulatory requirements, or the bank’s Jaywan product offerings."
