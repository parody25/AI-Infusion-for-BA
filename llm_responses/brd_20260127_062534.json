    "overview": "This Business Requirement Specification defines the high-level and detailed business requirements for a UAE licensed financial institution to comply with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) mandate to enable the Jaywan domestic card scheme and to issue Jaywan mono-badged and Jaywan co-badged cards. The document focuses on ensuring that card issuance, transaction routing, messaging, reconciliation, reporting, and customer experience are aligned with Al Etihad Payments (AEP) Jaywan scheme rules and CBUAE circulars, including the requirement that cards support both domestic and international transactions. The requirements cover enablement of Jaywan for ATM, POS, ecommerce, tokenised transactions, dual messaging flows, and readiness for wallet and international acceptance expansion in line with the CBUAE-classified public communications.",
    "current_constraint": "The current card issuing landscape is primarily dependent on international schemes (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) for both domestic and international transactions. This results in higher transaction costs for domestic payments, dependency on external schemes for critical payment infrastructure, and limited alignment with the CBUAE objective of strengthening financial sovereignty and reducing payment costs. Existing systems and processes are configured for current SMS for ATM and POS, and for Visa dual message (DMS) for ecommerce and tokenisation transactions only, without full support for the CBUAE domestic dual messaging model for Jaywan. Existing routing rules, GL structures, reconciliation processes, dispute processes, and reports have been designed for current international schemes rather than a domestic scheme operated by AEP.",
    "objective": "The business objective is to comply with the central government of the UAE and CBUAE circular (including mandate reference 5480/2024) requiring all licensed financial institutions to launch Jaywan cards and to issue Jaywan co-badged cards together with international schemes. The institution shall support Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage and Jaywan co-badged cards with international payment networks for both domestic and international usage. The institution shall configure card routing such that domestic transactions are processed via Jaywan where applicable, while international transactions are processed via the relevant international scheme. The objective is to reduce domestic payment costs, support the UAE’s position as a global digital payments hub, and provide customers with secure, seamless, and compliant payment experiences across physical, ecommerce, tokenised, and wallet channels, locally and abroad.",
    "in_scope": "1. Enablement of Jaywan domestic card scheme acceptance and issuance in line with AEP readiness for 2025.\n2. Issuance of Jaywan mono-badged debit/credit/prepaid cards for domestic and GCC usage as per AEP and CBUAE guidance, subject to scheme support.\n3. Issuance of Jaywan co-badged cards in partnership with an international payment network (e.g. Visa or Mastercard) for domestic and international usage.\n4. Configuration of card and transaction routing rules to support domestic routing via Jaywan and international routing via international schemes.\n5. Support for dual messaging systems for Jaywan and for existing international scheme flows, including authorisation, clearing, and settlement.\n6. Inclusion of ecommerce and tokenised transactions in CBUAE DMS scope for Jaywan, in line with documented to-be process flows.\n7. Support for POS, ATM, CDM, ecommerce, and tokenised transaction flows for Jaywan cards.\n8. High-level readiness to support Jaywan cards in mobile wallets (Samsung Wallet, Google Pay, Apple Pay) in alignment with AEP and scheme timelines.\n9. Design and alignment of GL accounts and posting rules for Jaywan-related transactions and fees, based on Finance team confirmation and CBUAE/AEP requirements.\n10. Reconciliation processes and reporting for Jaywan card transactions, including scheme settlement reports and regulatory reporting.\n11. Business support for reversals, refunds, chargebacks, and disputes related to Jaywan transactions.\n12. Stakeholder engagement with AEP and internal teams (Business, IT, Card Operations, GBO-ATM/CDM, Finance) to clarify requirements and address open queries.\n13. Discovery and documentation of additional requirements for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards through structured sessions as per meeting schedules.",
    "out_of_scope": "1. Detailed technical design, low-level system architecture, and code-level implementation for Jaywan enablement.\n2. Pricing strategies, interchange fee structures, and commercial negotiation with AEP or international schemes.\n3. Detailed legal agreements and contracts with AEP, Visa, Mastercard, or other international networks.\n4. Non-card payment instruments (e.g. account-to-account instant payments outside card context) except where required for reconciliation.\n5. Front-end UI/UX design details for mobile or internet banking screens beyond high-level functional behaviour.\n6. Marketing content design for the Jaywan awareness campaign beyond business requirements for customer communication and training.\n7. Non-UAE regulatory frameworks unless explicitly cross-referenced by CBUAE or AEP.\n8. Implementation of bilateral acceptance details with foreign countries (e.g. India and others) beyond high-level business and routing requirements.",
    "reference_documents": "1. CBUAE Circular and central government mandate requiring licensed financial institutions to launch Jaywan and issue co-badged cards (including mandate reference 5480/2024, as communicated).\n2. AEP and CBUAE public communication: \"Jaywan: UAE's new domestic card payment scheme; all your questions answered\".\n3. AEP and CBUAE public communication: \"Jaywan – the UAE's First Domestic Card Scheme Introduced to Strengthen the UAE's Position as a Global Hub for Digital Payments\".\n4. Internal process documentation for current SMS (ATM, POS) transactions.\n5. Internal process documentation for current Visa DMS (ecommerce and tokenisation transactions).\n6. Internal documentation for target CBUAE dual messaging system (DMS) for ecommerce and tokenisation transactions.\n7. Original reconciliation report shared by CBUAE / AEP and internal Finance teams.\n8. Minutes of meetings between Business, IT, Card Operations, GBO-ATM/CDM, Finance, and external parties regarding Jaywan, dual messaging, reconciliation, and reporting.\n9.

For co-badged cards, domestic transactions shall be routed to Jaywan by default and only fall back to the international scheme when Jaywan is not available or when required by scheme rules. International transactions, including foreign merchants and ATMs, shall be routed to the appropriate international scheme associated with the co-badged card.

Monitoring reports shall show that the majority of eligible domestic transactions for Jaywan co-badged cards are processed via Jaywan rather than international schemes.",
      "alternate_flows": "1. If the acquirer or terminal does not support Jaywan, the Jaywan co-badged card transaction shall be routed via the co-badge international scheme, with appropriate logging for monitoring.\n2.
