    "id": "BRD-JAYWAN-001",
    "program": "Jaywan Domestic Card Scheme Implementation for Licensed Financial Institutions in UAE",
    "type": "Business Requirements Specification (BRS)",
    "overview": "This document defines the business requirements for enabling the UAE domestic payment card scheme \"Jaywan\" for mono-badged and co-badged card products in accordance with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) mandate and the Al Etihad Payments (AEP) guidelines. The requirements cover card issuance, transaction routing for domestic and international usage, support for GCC usage where applicable, readiness for mobile wallets, and alignment with dual messaging and reconciliation processes. The document also addresses integration with CBUAE / AEP infrastructure to support secure, seamless, and cost-efficient card payments locally and, through co-badging and bilateral agreements, internationally.",
    "current_constraint": "Licensed financial institutions currently issue predominantly international scheme cards (e.g. Visa, Mastercard) and follow existing VISA DMS and current SMS (ATM, POS) processes. Domestic Jaywan scheme processing for e-commerce, tokenization and GCC usage is not fully implemented. Detailed guidance on routing logic, handling of reversals, refunds and chargebacks for Jaywan transactions, and alignment with CBUAE DMS flows is still under clarification with AEP. POS tokenized transactions for Jaywan may not yet be fully in scope of existing systems. The finalised bilateral agreements with external jurisdictions such as India and technical specifications for Google Pay and Apple Pay enablement are not fully available within the bank at the time of this document.",
    "objective": "The objective is to ensure that the bank, as a licensed financial institution under CBUAE, shall comply with the central government and CBUAE circulars mandating the launch of Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards. The bank shall design, configure and operate its card management, authorization, switching and settlement processes to support domestic Jaywan transactions, GCC usage where required, and international transactions via co-badged arrangements with international schemes. The implementation shall reduce domestic payment costs, enhance payment security, ensure financial sovereignty, and provide a seamless customer experience across physical cards and digital wallets, while complying with CBUAE and AEP operational and regulatory requirements, including mandate reference 5480-2024.",
    "in_scope": "1. Issuance of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and permitted GCC usage as per AEP and CBUAE direction.\n2. Issuance of Jaywan co-badged cards (Jaywan + Visa or Jaywan + Mastercard) for combined domestic and international usage in line with CBUAE mandate reference 5480-2024.\n3. Configuration of card routing rules to ensure domestic transactions are processed via Jaywan and international transactions via the relevant international scheme in accordance with CBUAE and AEP requirements.\n4. Enablement of Jaywan cards (mono-badged and co-badged) on supported mobile and digital wallets (e.g. Samsung Wallet initially, and readiness for Google Pay and Apple Pay) based on AEP readiness.\n5. Alignment of authorization, clearing and settlement flows with CBUAE Domestic Messaging System (DMS) for Jaywan, including e-commerce and tokenization transactions.\n6. Impact assessment and adaptation of dual messaging system processes for ATM, POS, e-commerce and tokenized transactions to support Jaywan.\n7. Definition of operational processes for reversals, refunds and chargebacks for Jaywan transactions, in line with AEP rules and CBUAE regulations.\n8. Updates to GL configurations and reconciliation processes to accommodate Jaywan transactions and related scheme fees.\n9. Reporting requirements to CBUAE / AEP and internal stakeholders for Jaywan transaction monitoring, performance and compliance.\n10. Stakeholder engagement and discovery sessions for additional requirements related to Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards.",
    "out_of_scope": "1. Detailed technical design, low-level system design and code-level specifications for card systems and switches.\n2. Commercial pricing agreements and interchange rate negotiations between the bank, AEP and international schemes.\n3. Legal documentation and contractual negotiation with AEP, CBUAE, Visa, Mastercard and other external parties.\n4. Non-card payment instruments and channels not related to Jaywan (e.g. account-to-account instant payments outside Jaywan scope).\n5. Detailed bilateral agreement terms and cross-border settlement mechanics for other countries beyond the high-level requirement to support such bilateral arrangements (e.g. India and other future corridors).\n6. Customer-facing marketing content and creative design for awareness campaigns, beyond the requirement that such campaigns shall be executed in coordination with AEP and CBUAE guidelines."
