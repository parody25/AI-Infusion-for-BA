    "overview": "This Business Requirements Document (BRD) defines the business requirements for enabling Jaywan mono-badged and Jaywan co-badged payment cards in alignment with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) and Al Etihad Payments (AEP) mandates. The Jaywan domestic card scheme is being introduced to strengthen the UAE’s financial sovereignty, reduce payment costs, and provide a secure and seamless payment experience across domestic and selected regional and international channels. Licensed financial institutions are required to offer Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage, and Jaywan co-badged cards in partnership with international payment networks (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, JCB) for domestic and international usage. This BRD covers business requirements arising from the CBUAE circular (including reference 5480/2024 as provided), AEP scheme rules as shared with the bank, and internal stakeholder workshops and discovery sessions, including those related to dual messaging, ATM/POS/SMS processes, tokenised transactions, and reconciliation and reporting expectations.",
    "current_constraint": "Currently, the bank issues and processes only international scheme cards (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, JCB) for domestic and international transactions. All domestic card transactions are routed via international schemes, which may result in higher interchange and processing costs, limited flexibility in applying local pricing, and dependency on cross-border scheme infrastructure. Existing systems and processes are configured primarily for international schemes and their dual messaging systems (DMS), with current documentation available for ATM, POS, SMS, and Visa DMS (including e-commerce and tokenisation transactions). Jaywan domestic scheme messages and routing rules are not yet implemented. POS tokenised transactions via domestic Jaywan rails are not fully defined. Reconciliation processes and General Ledger (GL) mapping for Jaywan scheme settlement are not yet embedded in production processes, although finance has confirmed readiness of GL details. Detailed operational procedures for reversals, refunds, chargebacks, and dispute handling under Jaywan scheme rules are partially understood and not yet fully documented. Discovery sessions for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged additional requirements have been scheduled but are not fully completed.",
    "objective": "The primary business objective is to comply with the CBUAE and central government mandate requiring all licensed financial institutions to launch Jaywan co-badged cards and, where applicable, Jaywan mono-badged cards, in accordance with CBUAE circular reference 5480/2024 and related communications. Banks currently issuing Visa or Mastercard cards shall in future issue co-badged cards that support both Jaywan for domestic transactions and international schemes for cross-border usage. Card routing shall be configured such that domestic transactions are processed via the Jaywan scheme and international transactions are processed via the respective international schemes. The solution shall support secure, cost-efficient, and seamless payment experiences across ATM, POS, e-commerce, tokenised wallets (e.g. Samsung Wallet, and later Google Pay and Apple Pay), and other relevant acceptance channels. The objective includes ensuring readiness of the bank’s systems, operations, and reporting to support the Jaywan scheme locally, and to provide a foundation for future regional and international expansion in line with AEP’s roadmap, including GCC usage and bilateral arrangements (e.g. India by mid-2025 as per shared context, where applicable).",
    "in_scope": "1. Enablement of Jaywan mono-badged card products for domestic UAE usage and GCC usage as per AEP guidance and CBUAE mandates, including card issuance, authorisation, clearing and settlement.\n2. Enablement of Jaywan co-badged cards (Jaywan + international scheme such as Visa or Mastercard or JCB) to support domestic transactions via Jaywan rails and international transactions via the respective international scheme rails.\n3. Configuration of routing logic and rules so that domestic transactions are preferentially routed to Jaywan in accordance with CBUAE and AEP directives, with support for local and GCC acceptance where applicable.\n4. Alignment with documented processes for current SMS (ATM, POS), Visa DMS (e-commerce and tokenisation), and definition of to-be CBUAE/Jaywan DMS for e-commerce and tokenisation transactions.\n5. Inclusion of POS tokenised transactions in scope for Jaywan scheme where applicable, including mobile wallets and token service providers as guided by AEP.\n6. Definition and implementation of end-to-end processes for reversals, refunds, chargebacks, and disputes for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, consistent with AEP and international scheme rules.\n7. Setup and usage of GL accounts for Jaywan-related settlement, fee income/expense and chargeback accounting, as confirmed by Finance.\n8. Implementation of regulatory and scheme-mandated reporting for Jaywan transactions and performance, leveraging original reports shared by CBUAE and AEP and bank-specific MIS and reconciliation needs.\n9. Discovery sessions and documentation of additional business requirements related to Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, as per the scheduled meetings and agreed agendas.\n10. Customer communication and awareness support from bank side, to align with AEP’s national awareness campaign and internal readiness for front-line staff.\n11. Integration readiness for mobile wallet support (e.g. Samsung Wallet) for Jaywan cards, with future enablement pathways for Google Pay and Apple Pay where governed by AEP and schemes.",
    "out_of_scope": "1. Detailed technical design, low-level solution design, and code-level changes, which shall be addressed in subsequent Solution Design Documents and Technical Design Documents.\n2. Issuance of non-card payment instruments that are not directly part of the Jaywan domestic card scheme (e.g. instant payments, QR-only propositions), unless explicitly mandated in future CBUAE or AEP communications.\n3. Definition or modification of AEP/CBUAE scheme rules themselves, including interchange and fee structures, which are governed by CBUAE and AEP and only referenced for compliance.\n4. Commercial pricing strategy and product pricing for customers (fees, charges, rewards), which shall be handled as a separate product and pricing exercise by business and product teams.\n5. Detailed bilateral arrangements and cross-border routing specifics with non-UAE markets (e.g. India or other countries) beyond what is mandated and documented by CBUAE/AEP at this stage; these will be covered in separate initiatives when detailed guidance is issued.\n6. Replacement or re-platforming of core banking or enterprise GL systems; only configuration changes tied to Jaywan card processing and reporting are in scope.\n7. Non-card-related fraud management tools beyond what is minimally required to handle Jaywan scheme fraud and monitoring requirements.\n8. End-to-end design of external merchant acquiring platforms beyond the bank’s existing acquiring infrastructure; only necessary changes to support Jaywan card acceptance are in scope where the bank is an acquirer.",

Specific TPS benchmarks shall be defined in technical design based on existing performance metrics.",
    "monthly_volume": "The solution shall be engineered to process total monthly Jaywan transaction volumes expected as a proportion of the bank’s domestic card transactions, with allowance for gradual migration from international schemes to Jaywan. Detailed monthly volume estimates shall be refined using current domestic transaction statistics and adoption forecasts.",
    "availability": "Jaywan-related systems and services (including card management, switching, and key customer channels) shall meet high availability objectives consistent with critical payment systems, typically targeting 24x7 availability with agreed maximum downtime windows aligned to regulatory and internal SLAs.

The bank shall ensure adherence to CBUAE requirements related to domestic routing, pricing, consumer protection, dispute handling, AML/CFT monitoring, data privacy, and reporting for Jaywan transactions.

Original reports shared by CBUAE or AEP shall be used as baselines, and enhancements requested by Finance and Operations shall be documented and implemented where feasible.",
