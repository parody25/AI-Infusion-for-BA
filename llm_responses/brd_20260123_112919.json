    "overview": "This Business Requirements Document defines the business requirements for implementing Jaywan mono-badged and Jaywan co-badged payment cards by a licensed financial institution in the United Arab Emirates, in alignment with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) mandate and Al Etihad Payments (AEP) domestic card scheme framework. The document addresses the enablement of Jaywan as the UAE’s domestic card scheme for domestic and GCC transactions, and Jaywan co-badged cards in partnership with international schemes (e.g., Visa, Mastercard) for international usage. The BRD focuses on compliance with the CBUAE circular and mandate reference number 5480-2024, ensuring that card products issued by the institution support both domestic and international transactions, with appropriate routing through Jaywan for domestic transactions. The document also captures high-level requirements for integration with AEP infrastructure, tokenization for mobile wallets, support for dual messaging models, reconciliation, and operational reporting as discussed in various stakeholder meetings and discovery sessions.",
    "current_constraint": "The current card issuance portfolio is based primarily on international schemes (e.g., Visa, Mastercard) and does not natively support the Jaywan domestic card scheme. Existing processes, system configurations, and routing logic are designed around current scheme rules and do not enforce mandatory domestic routing via Jaywan for eligible transactions in the UAE. Dual messaging processes are aligned to existing Visa processes and may require adaptation for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, including e-commerce and tokenized transactions. Existing reconciliation documentation and reports are based on international schemes and require extension or changes to incorporate Jaywan-specific General Ledger (GL) accounts, fees, and settlement positions. Mobile wallet enablement is partially in place for existing schemes and must be extended to support Jaywan for Samsung Wallet in the near term and for Google Pay and Apple Pay in the next phase, in accordance with AEP’s rollout timelines.",
    "objective": "The primary objective is to ensure the licensed financial institution complies with the CBUAE mandate (reference number 5480-2024) requiring issuance and enablement of Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards. The implementation shall: (1) enable issuance and life cycle management of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage; (2) enable issuance and life cycle management of Jaywan co-badged cards with international schemes for domestic and international usage; (3) configure card routing logic so that eligible domestic transactions are processed via Jaywan in accordance with CBUAE and AEP rules; (4) ensure operational readiness across authorization, clearing, settlement, reconciliation, disputes, chargebacks, and refunds for Jaywan; and (5) support tokenized transactions for POS and e-commerce, including integration with mobile wallets, in line with the planned AEP and CBUAE roadmap, while providing a secure, cost-efficient, and seamless payment experience to customers.",
    "in_scope": "Implementation of Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged debit and/or prepaid card products as mandated by CBUAE; configuration of routing rules to prioritize Jaywan for eligible domestic transactions; adaptation of existing dual messaging processes to support Jaywan, including authorization, clearing, and settlement flows; support for domestic and GCC transactions for mono-badged Jaywan cards; support for domestic and international transactions for Jaywan co-badged cards with international schemes; integration with AEP and Jaywan-related infrastructure as enabled by CBUAE and AEP; inclusion of POS, ATM, e-commerce, and tokenized transactions (including POS tokenized) within the Jaywan processing scope, subject to scheme readiness; update of GL structure, reconciliation processes, and reports to incorporate Jaywan transaction flows; enhancements to support reversals, refunds, and chargebacks for Jaywan transactions; alignment with forthcoming AEP awareness campaign from April 2025 for customer and corporate communications; and requirements gathering through discovery sessions for additional features specific to Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards.",
    "out_of_scope": "Design and implementation details of core switching infrastructure at AEP and CBUAE; detailed technical specifications of international schemes (Visa, Mastercard) beyond what is required to support co-badging with Jaywan; implementation of bilateral agreements outside those communicated by AEP (e.g., operational details of future bilateral arrangements with India and other countries beyond the high-level requirement to support such expansion when mandated); non-card payment instruments and products not related to the Jaywan card scheme; changes to non-CBUAE regulated entities; and marketing campaign content development beyond providing necessary inputs to the institution’s marketing teams.",
    "reference_documents": "CBUAE Mandate Reference Number 5480-2024 regarding domestic and international support on co-badged cards; CBUAE and AEP circulars and public communications on Jaywan, including AEP announcement dated 27 February 2025 on readiness of the Jaywan domestic card scheme; CBUAE Circulars regarding readiness of financial infrastructure to activate Jaywan locally and globally; AEP documentation on mono-badge and co-badge options and usage scope (local, GCC, and international); existing institution process documentation for current SMS (ATM, POS) and Visa dual messaging (e-commerce and tokenization); CBUAE domestic messaging system (DMS) to-be process documentation for e-commerce and tokenization; meeting minutes and discovery session notes involving Business, IT, Card Operations, ATM/CDM teams, and Finance regarding Jaywan implementation and reconciliation; and communications from AEP on mobile wallet enablement (Samsung Wallet, Google Pay, Apple Pay) and upcoming awareness campaigns."

Financial reports shall detail settlement positions, fee income and expenses, interchange, and chargeback-related financials, segregated between Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged portfolios. Reconciliation reports shall show variances between Jaywan scheme files, switch logs, and GL postings, with exception lists for investigation.
