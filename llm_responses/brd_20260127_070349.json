    "overview": "This document specifies the business requirements for a UAE licensed financial institution to comply with the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) mandate and Al Etihad Payments (AEP) directives for the implementation of the Jaywan domestic card scheme. The requirements cover issuance and acceptance of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage and Jaywan co-badged cards in partnership with international payment networks for both domestic and international usage. The document addresses card routing for domestic versus international transactions, support for dual messaging for e-commerce and tokenized transactions, readiness of infrastructure for local and global activation, and support for wallet tokenization and bilateral usage expansion in line with the AEP roadmap.",
    "current_constraint": "CBUAE has issued a circular, referenced as central bank mandate number 5480 2024, requiring all licensed financial institutions to launch Jaywan co-badged cards and to ensure that cards support both domestic and international transactions. Existing card portfolios are predominantly MasterCard and/or Visa only and do not natively support Jaywan domestic routing. Current processes are aligned with existing VISA Dual Message System (DMS) for e-commerce and tokenization transactions and do not fully cater for CBUAE DMS requirements for Jaywan. Card routing, GL configuration, reconciliation, and operational processes are not yet fully configured for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged card products as per AEP guidelines. Information in the provided contexts is high-level and does not contain detailed technical or fee-structure specifications, which shall be obtained from AEP and detailed scheme rulebooks.",
    "objective": "The primary objective is to enable the bank, as a CBUAE-licensed financial institution, to comply with the CBUAE circular mandating Jaywan scheme adoption by launching and servicing Jaywan mono-badged and Jaywan co-badged payment cards. The solution shall: (1) support issuance and lifecycle management of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic and GCC usage; (2) support issuance and lifecycle management of Jaywan co-badged cards with international payment schemes for domestic and international usage; (3) ensure that domestic transactions are routed via the Jaywan / AEP infrastructure in accordance with CBUAE and AEP rules; (4) ensure dual messaging support for e-commerce and tokenized transactions as per CBUAE DMS; (5) ensure readiness for mobile wallet tokenization (e.g. Samsung Wallet, and to-be Google Pay and Apple Pay) in line with AEP timelines; and (6) provide a secure, cost-efficient and seamless payment experience aligned with the national objective of strengthening financial sovereignty and digital payments leadership.",
    "in_scope": "1) Business and system requirements for issuance of Jaywan mono-badged debit/credit/prepaid cards for domestic and GCC usage, subject to AEP rules. 2) Business and system requirements for issuance of Jaywan co-badged cards in partnership with international payment networks (e.g. MasterCard or Visa) for domestic and international usage in accordance with central bank mandate 5480 2024. 3) Configuration of card routing logic to distinguish and route domestic transactions via Jaywan and international transactions via the co-badge international network in compliance with CBUAE and AEP rules. 4) Adaptation of existing VISA Dual Message System (DMS) processes to accommodate CBUAE DMS for Jaywan for e-commerce and tokenization transactions. 5) Inclusion of POS tokenized transactions within Jaywan scope, subject to AEP and scheme confirmations. 6) Setup and validation of GL accounts and reconciliation processes associated with Jaywan transaction processing as confirmed by Finance. 7) Changes to operational processes for reversals, refunds and chargebacks in context of Jaywan scheme. 8) Reporting requirements to CBUAE, AEP and internal stakeholders for Jaywan transaction volumes, performance and reconciliation. 9) Support for provisioning of Jaywan cards to supported mobile wallets (e.g. Samsung Wallet and future Google Pay and Apple Pay), in alignment with AEP rollout and scheme guidelines. 10) Discovery sessions and requirements elaboration for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged card products as per the meeting schedule referenced in the contexts.",
    "out_of_scope": "1) Detailed network fee structures, interchange rates and scheme economics, which shall be governed by separate commercial agreements and AEP/scheme rulebooks. 2) Detailed bilateral agreement implementation with India and other countries beyond high-level readiness requirements; specific corridor rules and technical integrations shall be handled under separate cross-border projects once AEP provides full specifications. 3) Non-card payment instruments (e.g. instant payments, wire transfers, cheques) not directly related to Jaywan card scheme. 4) Technical solution design, low-level system architecture, and vendor-specific implementation details, which shall be covered in subsequent Solution Design Documents. 5) Non-UAE regulatory frameworks other than references to bilateral expansion where applicable. 6) Marketing content creation for the Jaywan awareness campaigns; only business support and capability readiness are within scope."
