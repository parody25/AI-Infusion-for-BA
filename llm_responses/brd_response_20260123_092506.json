  "program": "Card Issuing and Payments Modernization – Jaywan Enablement",
  "type": "Business Requirements Specification",
  "table_of_content": "",
  "overview": "This Business Requirements Specification (BRS) captures high-level business requirements for enabling Jaywan domestic card scheme support within the bank’s card issuing and acquiring ecosystem, in alignment with the UAE Central Bank (CBUAE) mandate and Al Etihad Payments (AEP) directives. The scope is limited to information explicitly provided in the referenced contexts and focuses on configuration and enablement of Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, domestic vs international routing, and alignment with dual messaging / domestic scheme processing as applicable. Ambiguous or missing information has been left blank or flagged as open questions.",
  "current_constraint": "The bank currently issues and processes card transactions using international schemes (e.g., Visa, MasterCard) with existing Dual Messaging System (DMS) processes for Visa e-commerce and tokenization transactions. There is no explicit mention of existing support for Jaywan domestic scheme, nor for mandatory co-badging of cards with Jaywan. Existing processes are defined for SMS (ATM, POS), current VISA DMS (e-commerce and tokenization transactions). Constraints include pending clarifications from AEP, incomplete documentation on CBUAE domestic scheme DMS for e-commerce and tokenization transactions, and pending reconciliation documentation.",
  "objective": "To comply with the CBUAE circular (mandate reference number 5480 2024) requiring all licensed financial institutions to launch Jaywan co-badged cards and support domestic and international transactions as per mandated routing rules, and to prepare for additional requirements related to Jaywan mono-badged cards and co-badged cards while ensuring secure, cost-efficient, and seamless payment experiences.",
  "in_scope": "1. Definition of business requirements for issuance and processing of Jaywan co-badged cards with international schemes (Visa or MasterCard) as mandated.\n2. Definition of high-level business requirements for potential issuance and processing of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic (UAE and GCC, where applicable) usage.\n3. High-level routing behavior for domestic vs international transactions in line with the CBUAE mandate that cards must support both domestic and international transactions.\n4. Consideration of DMS process alignment for Jaywan in line with current VISA DMS (where explicitly mentioned), including e-commerce and tokenization transactions (subject to clarification).\n5. Inclusion of requirements for reporting and reconciliation where referenced (original report from CBUAE and requested reconciliation documentation).\n6. Planning for discovery sessions focused on additional requirements for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards.",
  "out_of_scope": "1. Detailed technical design, interface specifications, and message formats for Jaywan scheme integration.\n2. Detailed operational procedures for chargebacks, reversals, refunds, and dispute management beyond what is explicitly referenced.\n3. Detailed mobile wallet integrations with Samsung Wallet, Google Pay, and Apple Pay, as implementation specifics are not provided.\n4. Bilateral agreement details with India or other countries for cross-border usage of Jaywan, beyond acknowledging future expansion.\n5. Any assumptions about fees, interchange, pricing models, or SLAs that are not explicitly stated in the provided context.",
