    "program": "Jaywan Domestic Card Scheme Enablement for Licensed Financial Institutions in UAE",
    "type": "Business Requirement Specification",
    "overview": "This document captures the business requirements for enabling the Jaywan domestic card scheme (mono-badged and co-badged) in compliance with Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) and Al Etihad Payments (AEP) directives. It covers functional and high-level non-functional requirements for card issuance, transaction routing, processing, reversals, refunds, chargebacks, reconciliation, and reporting across channels including ATM, POS (including tokenized POS), e-commerce and digital wallets. The scope is limited to what is explicitly stated in the available CBUAE / AEP communications and meeting notes and does not introduce any assumptions beyond that context.",
    "current_constraint": "1. Existing card portfolios are primarily MasterCard and Visa based and do not natively support the Jaywan domestic card scheme.\n2. Current dual messaging and settlement processes are designed around existing Visa DMS and other international schemes and may not yet be aligned with CBUAE Domestic Messaging System (DMS) requirements for Jaywan.\n3. Existing routing configurations are aligned to international schemes and are not yet configured to prioritise domestic routing for Jaywan transactions.\n4. POS tokenized transaction handling is currently designed for existing schemes and may not explicitly include Jaywan-specific processing.\n5. Detailed service level parameters, performance benchmarks, and complete interface specifications from AEP for Jaywan and CBUAE DMS are not included in the provided context and therefore shall not be assumed in this document.",
    "objective": "1. Licensed financial institutions shall comply with the UAE central government and CBUAE mandate requiring issuance and support of Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged cards, including mandate reference 5480-2024 as referenced in the provided context.\n2. The institution shall support Jaywan as a domestic card payment scheme to strengthen financial sovereignty, reduce payment transaction costs, and enhance digital payment adoption in the UAE in line with CBUAE and AEP objectives.\n3. The institution shall ensure card products support both domestic and international transactions through appropriate configuration of routing and co-badging with international schemes (e.g. Visa, MasterCard), as explicitly mandated.\n4. The institution shall align its processes and systems for ATM, POS, e-commerce, tokenization, digital wallets and reconciliation with the readiness of the financial infrastructure for Jaywan as communicated by AEP and CBUAE.",
    "in_scope": "1. Enablement of Jaywan mono-badged cards for domestic usage in the UAE and GCC, based on CBUAE / AEP guidance in the provided content.\n2. Enablement of Jaywan co-badged cards with international schemes (e.g. Visa, MasterCard) for domestic and international usage in line with the mandate that future cards shall support both domestic and international transactions.\n3. Configuration of card routing rules so that domestic transactions shall be routed through the Jaywan domestic card scheme and international transactions shall be routed through the co-badged international scheme, as applicable.\n4. Alignment of existing dual messaging processes with CBUAE Domestic Messaging System (DMS) for e-commerce and tokenization transactions as referenced in the documented process flows.\n5. Inclusion of POS tokenized transactions in the scope of Jaywan-related processing as highlighted by business stakeholders.\n6. Coverage of reversals, refunds, and chargebacks processing for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged transactions in line with bank’s existing processes where explicitly referenced.\n7. Preparation and refinement of reconciliation documentation and processes related to Jaywan transactions including reports obtained from CBUAE / AEP as mentioned.\n8. Coordination of discovery sessions and demand discussions for Jaywan mono-badged and co-badged additional requirements as per the referenced meeting schedule.\n9. Support for tokenization and provisioning of Jaywan cards into Samsung Wallet and preparation for enablement on Google Pay and Apple Pay as referenced in the CBUAE-classified public content.\n10. High-level training, awareness, and change management requirements for Business, IT and Operations teams in line with AEP awareness campaigns and bank internal readiness.",
    "out_of_scope": "1. Detailed technical interface specifications, message formats, and API definitions for Jaywan and CBUAE DMS, as these are not provided in the context and are covered by separate technical design documents issued by AEP / CBUAE.\n2. Detailed scheme rules, fee structures, interchange rates, and settlement calendars for Jaywan and international schemes, as these are governed by separate scheme documentation not provided in the context.\n3. Detailed configuration parameters for Samsung Wallet, Google Pay, and Apple Pay tokenization services, which will be managed under separate integration projects and vendor documentation.\n4. Any non-UAE regulatory requirements, as the context is limited to CBUAE and UAE central government directives.\n5. Product marketing content and brand guidelines for Jaywan cards beyond high-level awareness and training dependencies.\n6. Detailed fraud management rules, scoring models, and AML scenarios, which will be addressed under separate risk and compliance workstreams once specific guidance and data are available."
