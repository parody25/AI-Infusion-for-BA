The customer experience team mainly sees the output, not the backend processes. Multiple onboarding channels exist, including MBIB branches and tablets, and all should be included in the data pull. Exclusion logic, such as Do Not Disturb (DND) customers and royal family members, is already applied consistently across surveys to avoid contacting these groups. Blacklisted customers do not receive accounts, as accounts are only opened after passing sanctions and KYC processes.\n\n Welcome Pack Delivery Status\n\nThe system tracks statuses like \"delivered to customer\" and \"received by customer,\" which may appear similar but have distinct meanings. Delivery without receipt indicates an incomplete process, as customers must sign for welcome packs to acknowledge receipt.\n\nThe report should focus on the \"delivered\" status to ensure accuracy in customer engagement tracking.\n\n Data Fields and Template Structure\n\nThe IT team uploads daily data files using a standardized template containing fixed and custom variables. Key fields include customer email, segment codes, account types (current or savings), branch names, touchpoints (typically CASA), nationality, gender, age ranges, preferred language (English or Arabic), and transaction details. Some fields like CRM name, ATM ID, relationship manager name, and tablet device name are often blank or optional.

The participants address existing uncertainties and dependencies on external inputs to finalize the Business Requirements Document (BRD) and operational workflows.\n\n Documentation and Reconciliation Logic\n\nThe meeting begins with a query about the need to document the business reconciliation logic in the BRD, specifically detailing the files to reconcile.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2132, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db248ec7-ec69-4d6f-97f3-80ee7c4a006b": {"__data__": {"id_": "db248ec7-ec69-4d6f-97f3-80ee7c4a006b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b51c7254-9ba3-4d03-9b0c-8e0add87992c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6af9c3e10c0d9e9776f130287f9a1c99d2dc4361efe808c7b09aa63dbd1004d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "against, data involved, and matching criteria. It is confirmed that this information has been provided to a team member named Farhan and discussed with the reconciliation team, but the documentation needs to be formalized and shared with all relevant teams to ensure clarity and avoid confusion. The responsible party agrees to send the related emails and documentation for consolidation and further queries will be raised as needed after reviewing the documents.\n\n General Ledger (GL) Structure and File Formats\n\nDiscussion then moves to the GL structure for transactions. It is clarified that there will be multiple GLs: one for ATM, one for POS (pause), and one for e-commerce transactions. The existence of tokenized and non-tokenized POS transactions is raised, with some uncertainty about their handling and tagging. The participants highlight the importance of confirming from the EPC (Electronic Payment Clearing) team whether files for these transactions will be sent as a single combined file or multiple separate files, as this affects the reconciliation process and GL accounting. There is concern over contradictory information from different sources regarding file formats and the number of files expected. The need for a clear and definitive response from EPC is stressed to avoid theoretical and ineffective solutions.\n\n Handling Single vs Multiple Files\n\nIf a single file contains mixed transaction types, the team discusses the need for an internal process or automated job to identify and segregate transactions into the appropriate GLs based on indicators within the file. This could involve building a job or manual processing depending on the final file structure. The entire reconciliation and transaction flow depends heavily on this confirmation, and the team acknowledges that the current approach is bottom-up without clarity at the top (file receipt and format). They emphasize the urgency of getting this information from EPC to proceed effectively.\n\n Follow-up Actions and Dependencies\n\nThe team agrees to push for clear answers from EPC and Bharat, who is responsible for communication with EPC, to expedite the resolution of these queries. One member offers to personally contact EPC representatives to obtain the necessary clarifications. They recognize that this is the sole major dependency holding back progress on the reconciliation process design and BRD completion. Meanwhile, other independent discussions will continue where possible.\n\n Reporting and Access\n\nQuestions are raised regarding the daily reports, including timing, cut-off, and access control. It is confirmed that reports will be generated daily, aligned with file receipt times from EPC. The reports will be Power BI-based, and access will be managed through existing folder permissions with no additional IT intervention needed. The team discusses the need to know user lists for access and confirms that reports will be placed in shared folders accessible to authorized users.\n\n Report Content and Exception Handling\n\nClarifications are sought about the fields in the reports, particularly distinguishing between successful transactions and exceptions. It is explained that successful transactions will be included in one report, while exceptions - such as declined transactions due to insufficient funds, account issues, or technical errors - will appear in a separate exceptions report.\n\nHowever, the exact reasons for exceptions may not be detailed unless the system can identify and provide rejection reasons. The report includes an indicator for e-commerce versus tokenized transactions, and some fields are new additions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3634, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f68bb72a-b5b5-4532-8061-eb745b7c8c3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f68bb72a-b5b5-4532-8061-eb745b7c8c3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf873228-a19d-4e23-b171-8b11cd6cd383", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a30abee6be64be0cd02fc33dfb27d8d54213f6f22cbcb52342aaffe955314cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "specific to these transaction types.

The team acknowledges the importance of resolving open questions to avoid repeated changes and inefficiencies.
