All downstream systems must accommodate 8-digit BINs, with masking logic aligned to PCI DSS requirements. Some systems (e.g., ATM) will not change their display logic, while others will be updated to show 8 digits.\n- E-commerce delivery is prioritized due to central bank mandates, with 8-digit BIN work to follow. UATs for e-commerce and 8-digit BIN may be segregated, and a separate plan for 8-digit BIN testing will be shared.\n- There is concern about potential duplication of testing if 8-digit BIN is implemented after e-commerce UAT; the team agreed to keep this as an open item and assess the impact further.\n\nApproach for NTB customers, is the approach suggested in section 4.1A finalized?\n\n- The approach for NTB customers is not finalized and remains an open item. Currently, only ETB customers can be issued cards, and a solution for NTB is pending approval from business heads.\n- The team agreed to bring this NTB issue to higher management for a decision.\n\nAs per FSD shared by core banking, any incoming Base 1 request will have a parameterized block of 14 days if identified as Jaywan; how would this impact e-commerce and tokenization as this was not mentioned in the BRD?\n\n- Core banking FSD introduces a parameterized hold (default 14 days) for Jaywan transactions, not explicitly mentioned in the BRD. The hold duration is configurable, and testing should ensure the hold is placed until settlement.\n- E-commerce and tokenization transactions will follow DMS protocol, placing a block first and releasing it upon settlement, similar to Visa transactions.\n\nNeed clarification on the scope on the acquiring side.\n\n- Acquiring not in scope for this phase.\n\nAs per BRD under transaction identifier, there should be a new narration for e-commerce transactions to be created; however, the exact narration is not mentioned or agreed in the document.\n\n- The business team will review current Visa narrations and requirements, and this will be finalized in an addendum.\n\n1. E-commerce transactions will be tested via simulator.\n2. Market Rollout &#x26; Customer Availability\n- Initial rollout is limited to staff due to NTB limitations. Once NTB issuance is enabled, all Jaywan cards will support e-commerce and tokenization. The business rollout plan depends on resolving the NTB approach.\n\nAs part of Jaywan Track 2 and 3 changes, we will need to have senior leadership direction and alignment on the below open items:\n\n1. We do not have solution implementation/development for NTB Jaywan Monobadge card onboarding; this has been marked as an open item in the BRD. So, from the UAT scoping per se as well from the business rollout plan, this needs to be sensitized and aligned, whether we will go with ETB and later move into NTB or launch for ETB &#x26; NTB together; accordingly, testing needs to be scoped.\n2. 8-digit BIN development is not completed, and the current priority/focus is on the E-commerce owing to CB mandate; however, if this is going to be delivered later than from UAT point of view, the testing needs to be repeated for E-commerce. This will impact extended UAT timelines or duplication of testing efforts by business. Further, in the context situation, if we conclude that 8-digit BIN will be delivered later, then we need to have a clear impact assessment of the changes so that we can test the right scenarios/functionalities rather than repeating the complete E-commerce scope.\n3. On the narration, this is not finalized yet by business, and post that it requires a good amount of development in core and subsequently on other impacted platforms for the narration to flow through. At this juncture, with tight UAT timelines, this piece of development coming in the later stage will put risk to UAT completion. So, a decision needs to be sought to have this in scope of Track 2 &#x26; 3 or can we mark this out of scope.\n4.

Accordingly, testing needs to be scoped.\n\nFrom the discussion that we are having with AEP, the next logical step would be to expand this to ETB Customers (Since we currently have close to 1 Mn CASA accounts).\n\n8-digit BIN development is not completed, and the current priority/focus is on the Ecom owing to CB mandate. However, if this is going to be delivered later than from UAT point of view, the testing needs to be repeated for Ecom. This will impact extended UAT timeliness or duplication of testing efforts by business.\n\nFurther, in the context/situation, if we conclude that 8-digit BIN will be delivered later, then we need to have a clear impact assessment of the changes so that we can test the right scenarios/functionalities rather than repeating the complete Ecom scope. We would want to understand the impact of this prior to commenting and tabling it at the senior management level.\n\nWe were of the understanding that this release includes 8-digit BIN upgrade.\n\n@ User 1) - Please understand what the impact of this will be from M and if needed from the team.\n\nOn the Narration, this is not finalized yet by business and post that it requires a good amount of development in core and subsequently on other impacted platforms for the narration to flow through.

So, a decision needs to be sought to have this in scope of Track 2 &#x26; 3 or can we mark this out of scope. Historically, narration has been a sticky topic and we need a direction from senior management on the way forward.\n\nMy understanding is that the current VISA narration shall be replicated from Jaywan side unless we are not receiving those details from Jaywan.\n\n@ User 1 - Please work with M to understand the history of why this was not captured in BRD and subsequently from DH team on the delivery timelines.\n\nLastly, we need to understand before calling business for kick start UAT, whether Track 2 &#x26; 3 will also be a staff roll-out or customer roll-out.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2451, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"3cadc165-d399-44a0-97e5-6a5939bd94f0": {"doc_hash": "5914d6c555084fda17f944e37662e36dc83bc635ea472a435381bf33d1cee6e1", "ref_doc_id": "c322c647-c3b1-48fb-98a1-4e5d94b6560d"}, "850313ff-2a03-4514-9d72-425059d9e940": {"doc_hash": "54d2d52d08e61f87078fa2b8aa961ef16410cd9cecb5d0fdfaa68ece6165049d", "ref_doc_id": "f6aa1f13-345d-46eb-84bf-1fa26b0f3656"}}}
