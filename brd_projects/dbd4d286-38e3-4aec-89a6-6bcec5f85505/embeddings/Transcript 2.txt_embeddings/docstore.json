Phase one, we are just blocking it, which is invisible to us, BA. We have no part in that.\n\n00:01:43.229 -> 00:01:59.509\n\nBA: Maybe I have a vested interest in base one because when we say we have a block right? So for it for it's not a tech, it's not a functional aspect, but for the block to be created, when exactly should the the block start? I mean when we have something called base one, there should be some cutoff time that should be ideally kept within our system also right that from then onwards till the X number of days that the AEP confirms till then it is going to be the block creation, so we should.\n\n00.02:09.429 -> 00:02-14.669\n\nUser 1: Yeah, I think Farhan has already asked that question.

So first we should we check the cut off time for base one to commence a block or is it OK to just know the block period and that should take care everywhere? I mean l'm just.\n\n00:03:24.709 -> 00:03:29.109\n\nUser 1\n\nYeah, I think F1, right.

OK. So that's anyway the existing question we have and recovery from I think F1, we had a question on will the recovery be on the come from the customer be executed during real time or EOD, what is recovery of this?\n\n00:03:55.349 -> 00:04:07.149\n\nUser 1\n\nRecovery is we don't know what time they are going to send that STP file BA so that how the whan we are going to run that when we are going to debit the customer\n\n00:04:08.269 -> 00:04:16.669\n\nBA\n\nOK, so can I rephrase it as when should or debit the customer should happen real time?\n\n00:04:13.429 -> 00:04:25.029\n\nUser 21T Dept)\n\nSo isn't this isn't this something internal face up like we will place a block. OK, we will place a block GG.\n\n00:04:21.589 -> 00:04:40.909\n\nUser 1\n\nBecause now Daly they are saying that 12:00 or till 5:00 they will be sending.

OK, now it will be good. What I understand from this is that for example if an ecos transition is done, so core will place a block of their specific amount on the customer account, let's say 100 AED transition is done.\n\n00:06:20.029 - 00:06:32.909\n\nUser 2 (OT Dept)\n\nSo they will place a block of 100 AED on the customer account and then once the base two file comes and core processes it then the customer will be debited. Actually this this this is how it happens.\n\n00:06:36.629 - 00:06:45.349\n\nUser 1\n\nYes, absolutely. This is how it happens, Varan. But when is the file going to come? The code space to file? What time is it going to come?\n\n00:06:45.189 - 00:06:47.069\n\nUser 2 (UT Dept)\n\nYeah, that that we are not sure, yes.\n\n00:06:50.709 - 00:06:54.309\n\nUser 2 (OT Dept)\n\nOK, just write it and then let them respond to this.\n\n00:06:54.389 - 00:07:05.829\n\nBA\n\nRight CK. I'll ask this question if it is going to be more clancer because the files are expected by 5 AM on the for the previous days transactions, when will the customer's account be debited using this base to file?\n\n00:07:06.309 - 00:07:21.709\n\nUser 1\n\nBecause why I'm saying this Farhan? See if for yesterday's transaction he sends me a settlement, a clearing file.
